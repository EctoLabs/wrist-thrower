## What's included
These file are intended to be used in conjunction with as many real-world parts as possible to create a deluxe replica as close to the original movie prop as possible. Therefore, only the main elements of the thrower body, shroud and mini-cyclotron are included here. Please refer to the Build Guide section below for everything else you need to complete the build.<br/><br/>

## How to download
Simply [click here](https://github.com/EctoLabs/wrist-thrower/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download all of the .stl files to your computer as a single ZIP.<br/><br/>

## Print settings
We recommend printing each model using the default orientation set in each file. We used a layer height of 0.3mm with a brim to help with adhesion to the print bed and to prevent any lifting. For any models that have overhang or hollow sections, be sure to add support material. If using Cura, <strong>disabling</strong> the 'Support interface' option will make removing the support material much easier. The 'body_main.stl' model, for example, will generate A LOT of support material but this can be removed by using pliers and pulling out sections bit by bit.<br /><br />

## Build guide & shopping list
A complete guide on building your own Wrist Thrower using the files supplied here is now available on the GBFans forum. This also includes an exhaustive list of everything you need, including exclusive details on various screen-accurate items used on the original movie prop:
